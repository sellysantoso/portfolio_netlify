<b><a name="description">Description</a> </b>
This is my first portfolio website written in HTML and CSS only.

<b><a name="Purpose">Purpose</a> </b>
As a beginner in Coder Academy Diploma to be a full stack developer, I decided to use the portfolio to showcase projects and work experiences that I have accomplished as a project marketing for property developments. My first objective is simplicity, accesibility and flexibility in my design and information flow.


<b><a name="functionality">Functionality</a> </b>

Easiness to use and simplicity is a priority hence I implemented a fixed position navigation bar to guide users throughout elements in the website.  

I also intend the website to be modular so I decided to use flex display to give flexibility and responsiveness to the website.  

I love colors but I try not to give too much weight to the purpose of the website to show case my skills and previous work achievements, so I use a paralax design and give the website a colorful background whilst maintaining the main feature of the website stays as black and white. 

I prioritize mobile first in design but I also compatible with desktops and the flex display is flexible to various display size.  

With a single-page scroll and a responsive navigation bar which transitions from a menu bar to a hamburger menu, users can navigate to each section via scroll or via anchor links from the menu 

<b><a name="sitemap">Sitemap</a></b>

<i><b>About me </b></i>

<i><b>Work Experience</b> </i>

I design my website into sections and navigable from the fixed location menu bar or by scrolling.  

<i><b>Home:</b></i> landing page featuring the background and navigation bar. 

<i><b>About Me:</b></i> a short biography. 

<i><b>Work experiences:</b></i> featuring flex display boxes 



<i><b>Social networks:</b></i> links to git repositories and LinkedIn account 

<i><b>Contact:</b></i> single click to send me email via a local browser. 

 
<b><a name="audience">Target Audience </a></b>
The website is to feature my skills in HTML and CSS and later on to display Ruby on Rails skills and Javascript. 

<b><a name="tech">Tech Stack </a></b>
My website was coded in HTML5 and CSS3, deployed via GitHub Pages and uses a Formspree API for the contact form. The overall design relied heavily on CSS flex box and paralax. Initial design and wireframes are designed using Figma. Email form is using href functionality. 

<a name="design">
<b>Logo </b>
I designed my logo as svg, and flip card. I commented the logo codes in HTML page as an error occured preventing it to be displayed. 
<b>Colour Scheme </b>
I always like negative space design ideas.

<b><a name="usability">Usability Considerations </b></a>
I chose to use fixed navigation bar to improve usability. Further improvements needed to include style sheet for various display screen sizes. 
<b><a name="design">Design Planning </b></a>

<b>Project Plan and Timeline </b>
Design process took one full day and I spent the next two days to code. 

<b><a name="challenges">Challenges </b></a>
I had to rebuild the entire website in another computer since water damage my laptop. I decided to use paralax css style to add color to a black and white style. It proven to be challening to maintain readibility when paralax is applied with flex and fixed position navigation bar. <br>
<b><a name="plan">Trello </b></a>
I use trello for time management. Limited time requires careful task management. 

<b><a name="enhancements">Further Enhancements </b></a>
Email (contact) form to use Formspree API. 
Graphical svg to display timeline for my work experiences.

<b><u>Question 1 </u></b>

 Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today (max. 150 words) 

Jan1, 1983    ARPANET adopted TCP/IP 

Researchers began to assemble the “network of networks” that became the modern Internet. The online world 

1990    Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web. The web is actually just the most common means of accessing data online in the form of websites and hyperlinks. The web helped popularize the Internet among the public, and served as a crucial step in developing the vast trove of information that most of us now access on a daily basis. 

In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[6] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.[4] 

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. 

HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[5] 

 
<b><u>Question 2</u></b> 

Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today (max. 150 words) 

Internet: Integrated Networking and Tim Berners Lee invented Web which are documents stored in the server computer which can be shared. The documents are written in HTML which is Hypertext Markup Language. Lee specified HTML in 1989 and written browser and server software to read HTML in 1990. 

 CSS which is Cascading Stylesheet is a document which describes how each HTML element will appear on screen, on paper or on media. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once, External stylesheets are stored in CSS files. CSS was proposed in October 10, 1994 by Hakon Wium Lie. 

Charles F. Goldfarb, Ed Mosher, and Ray Lorie at IBM in the 1970s invented XML which is Extensible Markup Language which is a markup language which encodes language that machine readable and human readable. Hundreds of document formats using XML syntax then have been developed such as SVG and XHTML. 

 

<b><u>Question 3</u></b> 

Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers (max. 150 words) 

The Domain Name Systems (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet e.g. www.google.com 

Web servers or Web browsers interact through eProtocol (IP) addresses. 

DNS translates Domains (domain names) to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources and eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as 192.168.1.1 (in IPv4), by converting a hostname (such as www.example.com) into a computer-friendly IP address (such as 192.168.1.1). An IP address is given to each device on the Internet
